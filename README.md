# random_omf_themeüê†
randomly install and enable theme from [oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) official packages repository for [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)
### Installationüõ´ & usage 
Install [oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) for fish shell first. And then execute these commands in the fish shell. 

`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/MilkyMAISHIRANUI/random_omf_theme $OMF_PATH/themes/random_omf_theme`

For a random theme, type this. 

`source $OMF_PATH/themes/random_omf_theme/functions/fish_prompt.fish` 

We are not listed in the oh-my-fish packages repository. Therefore you could not use `omf install` command.
### known issues ‚ö†Ô∏è 
`omf theme random_omf_theme` command could not change the theme sometimes. We recommend the `source` command.
