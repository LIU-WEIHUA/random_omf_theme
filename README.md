# random_omf_themeüê†
randomly install and enable themes from [official packages repository](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/packages-main) of [oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish)  for [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)
### Installation & Usageüõ´ 
Install [oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish#installation) for the fish shell first. And then execute these commands in the fish shell. 
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/MilkyMAISHIRANUI/random_omf_theme $OMF_PATH/themes/random_omf_theme
```
For a random theme, type this. 
```
omf theme random_omf_theme
```
We are not listed in the oh-my-fish packages repository. Therefore you could not use the `omf install random_omf_theme` command.
### Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è 
 `fish_config` command persists the prompt to `~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` . That file takes precedence over Oh My Fish's themes. Therefore command `omf theme <theme_name>` will not work. Theme `sashimi` and others will cause this issue.
To fix it as `omf doctor` suggested, enter this command `rm ~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish` .
Or type this command `source $OMF_PATH/themes/random_omf_theme/functions/fish_prompt.fish` and let us do that for you automatically and enable a new random theme.
